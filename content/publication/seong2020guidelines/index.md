abstract: Cyber security visualization designers can benefit from human factors engineering concepts and principles to resolve key human factors challenges in visual interface design. We survey human factors concepts and principles that have been applied in the past decade of human factors research. We highlight these concepts and relate them to cybersecurity visualization design. We provide guidelines to help cybersecurity visualization designers address some human factors challenges in the context of interface design. We use ecological interface design approach to present human factors-based principles of interface design for visualization. Cyber security visualization designers will benefit from human factors engineering concepts and principles to resolve key human factors challenges in visual interface design.
