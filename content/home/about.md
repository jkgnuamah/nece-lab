The NeuroErgonomics and Cognitive Engineering (NeCE) Lab is focused on understanding neural, physiological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying human-system interactions, and using that knowledge to inform the design, development, and assessment of cyber-physical systems with the goal of enhancing productivity, safety, and health.

Areas of application include aviation, health care, surface transportation, energy, and military systems.
