Cognitive workload (CWL), a multidimensional construct whose measurement is challenging, has been associated with performance decrements, which is a major concern in safety-critical systems such as aviation, and medicine. While advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to increased use of physiological measurements to assess CWL, researchers have reported insensitivities and dissociations between physiological measures of CWL. This research investigates insensitivities and dissociations between physiological measures of CWL.
