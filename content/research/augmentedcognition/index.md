Advances in sensor technology enable researchers to noninvasively sense an operator’s cognitive state during the operator’s interaction with a system. The sensed data can be assessed relative to (performance or cognitive) baseline(s). Armed with this knowledge, the operator’s performance and/or cognitive state can be augmented to meet or exceed performance requirements. This research seeks to use neuroimaging techniques to determine the cognitive state of an individual and then augment human-system interaction to meet or exceed performance requirements.
