Traditional human-system interfaces are designed to promote ease of use but have little regard for the impact that they have on usersâ€™ cognitive representations. This research investigates how human-system interactions may be improved by incorporating both analytical and intuitive cognition in them. We seek to develop information representations that map directly onto human intuitive processes by integrating and optimally presenting
information based on human cognitive abilities and limitations.
